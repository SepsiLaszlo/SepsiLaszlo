I'm glad you found my blog!

My name is László Sepsi, and I'm a Software Engineer from Hungary.

I enthusiastically love the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language for its human-friendly syntax. I admire the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) full-stack web application framework for making web application development a bliss, enabling programmers to ship features quickly.

I'm also interested in DevOps, web application architectures, startup culture, and managing the software development lifecycle effectively.

This blog is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
